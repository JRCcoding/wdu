        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>A little bit about myself, a very loaded question indeed but sometimes I really enjoy talking about myself so that's great! I'm a huge family person, family has always been at the top
             of my priorities. My mother passed away due to her illness and I have two brothers, one with Cerebral Palsy and the other just a little goofy. My dad has made a huge impact in my life. 
             Through thick and thin he always was the best man he could be for his wife and children.</p>
        <p>I have my own family now, and they are amazing. My incredible wife is literally always trying to do more for me and the kids, and I love and appreciate her so so much.</p>
